# HTML forms  - Introductio
A personal, public repository where I build and upload different HTML forms such as login forms, register forms and contact forms. The idea behind this is to practice my design and coding skills. All forms will be written in HTML, CSS and some basic Javascript.
I create my own designs for the forms by using Figma (design software).



## How to navigate in the repository
I will be making several different html form projects in this repository. Each project will have its own named folder, and
you can access the projects and their content by clicking the folders (just like you would on your computer).
