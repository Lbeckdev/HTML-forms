# HTML-forms
A personal, public repository where I build and upload different HTML forms such as login forms, register forms and contact forms. The idea behind this is to practice my design and coding skills. All forms will be written in HTML, CSS and some basic Javascript.
I create my own designs for the forms by using Figma (design software).
